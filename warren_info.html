							<p>Warren East Asia Research Foundation (WRF) established itself as a nonprofit organization on October 2014 with close to a decade long experience in the field of social science research and higher education consulting. WRF was established under a partnership between KISON (Korea Information Source on the Net), an organization that has been dedicated to the research of US-Korea relations since 2000, and KOPRI (Korea Peace Research Institute), a research firm, operating since 2008. KISON fulfilled a key role in the establishment of WRF with its industry proven credentials and experiences. On February 2015, WRF has been granted 501(c)(3) status, affirming to its charitable and educational cause (*All donations made to WRF, will now be tax deductible to the maximum extent allowed by law).</p>
							<p>At the center of the establishment of WRF was Mr. Heung Hwan Lee, and Dr. Sejin Jeong, Prof. Cho Won Lee, Prof. Jung Jin Park and others are currently serving as Board Members. Throughout the process of establishing Warren, some key principles and concepts were agreed upon. Prof. Jung Jin Park of Tsuda College of Japan and others all came to the consensus that a more organic, formative link was needed between the US and East Asia. WRF will strive to manifest this belief through its programs and activities.</p>
							<p>WRF seeks to fulfill a unique, dual role as both a global think net and a consulting organization. Warren will actively seek out like minded higher education institutions in East Asia and Europe for possible co-venture programs, research projects, and other mutually beneficial opportunities. WRF firmly believes in the necessity for utilization of global elements present in today’s world.</p>
							<p>To fulfil its vision of becoming a small, but substantive global think net, WRF is currently appointing several professors from Tsuda College, Inha Univ., Soongsil Univ., as the Warren Scholars for possible research projects and more. Contact and progress with the Asia Foundation, the Asia Society and One Asia Foundation has also been made for possible research projects and more.</p>
							<p>The Center for American Studies (CAS) has also been established as a division of WRF on November 2016. With the expertise and industry proven knowledge of KISON serving as a basis for the design of CAS, it will seek to bridge any gaps between East Asia and the US.</p>
							<p>As part of an ongoing effort to help bridge the gap between East Asia and the US, a debate session in a roundtable format, also known as “Warren Roundtable”, has been taking place quarterly since the establishment of WRF . Most notably, on June 26th 2015 at the Tysons Corner 's lecture room, Prof. Taewan Kim of Dong-Eui University, presented  his paper of "The China’s Announcement of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) Initiative</p>
							<p>On July 2017,  Kil-Jae Rhu, the former Secretary of Unification in South Korea, presented his paper of "The Critical Review of Reconciliation of the Korean Peninsular". CAS seeks to meet the needs of government employees and media employees from East Asia by continually hosting programs such as the CAS roundtable and other local training sessions. Also, as a mid term goal, WRF  plans to create programs centered on American studies, East Asian Studies and International Relations into one or two year Master programs.</p>
							<p>In June 2018, as a minority-focused community service organization, we established the Dr. Jeong's College Success (DJCS) program, the successor of the former KOPRI College Success Program. This is helping students maximize their eligibility for need-based aid funded by the federal and state government, as well as the colleges programs themselves. Dr. Jeong has comprehensive approaches and solutions designed to help students minimize their college costs.</p>
