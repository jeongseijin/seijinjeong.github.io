							<h2>Mission:</h2>
							<p>Assisting students with maximizing eligibility for need-based aid funded by the  federal and state governments, as well as the colleges themselves.</p>
							<p>The WARREN's DJCS Program has comprehensive approaches and solutions designed to help you minimize college costs and maximize your eligibility for student financial aid.</p>
							<p>The formulas used to determine aid eligibility are basically the same at all schools.  Indeed our research has shown that the sooner families begin using our service, the more aid they are likely to receive.  It is therefore in your best interest to return your completed questionnaire and most recent tax returns to us as soon as possible.</p>
							<p>For some families the sophomore or junior year in high school is not too early to enroll, although we will always do our best no matter how little planning time is involved. Since our service is also very seasonal, prompt response will insure timely service.</p>
							<p>For many families, paying a fee to a service when you want to reduce college expenses may seem ironic.  However, our experience in counseling several thousand families has shown that few families have the time and/or the expertise to know how to qualify for the most financial aid and how to choose the least expensive financing options. </p></p>
							<p>Recent investigations by state attorneys general and other government officials have also exposed the fact that college administrators often act more to benefit themselves and their employers when dispensing “free” advice to students and their families.  </p>
							<h4>This service includes: </h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Customized worksheets detailing how much the family will be expected to contribute to college costs based on both the federal and the CSS institutional aid formulas.</li>
								<li>Financial aid fact sheets on the colleges being considered.</li>
								<li>A personal consultation by appointment (up to one hour and a half).  During this meeting, we will review with you the computer printouts and aid fact sheets listed above, we will explain the various steps involved in the financial aid process. And if appropriate, we will provide you with specific recommendations for increasing your aid eligibility based upon your personal situation.</li>
								<li>At the appropriate time, we will assist you with the preparation of the standardized aid form(s) which will include the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and if appropriate, the CSS' Financial Aid PROFILE form for one academic year.</li>
								<li>Detailed correspondence from our office during the fall and spring terms which precede the academic year for which aid is desired.  These letters are designed to assist you throughout the aid process so that maximum benefits can be achieved.</li>
								<li>Additional consultation time after the first 90 minutes and/or additional fees for the review or preparation of Noncustodial Parent Statements, Business/Farm Supplements, Loan Applications, and individual college aid forms  will be charged. For the majority of our clients, these additional fees are not applicable. </li>
